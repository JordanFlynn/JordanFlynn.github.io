        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a 4th year university student at South East Technological University studying Applied Computing/Computer Science, specializing in Cloud Networks. I've always 
            been interested in technology and how things work so I took it upon myself to return to full time education in my mid-twenties to push myself further and develop 
            the skills needed to enter the working world in the software sector.
        </p></n>
        <p>
            One of my passions is playing guitar which I started learning just over a year ago. This self-taught approach is fun and exciting but came with a couple of
            challenges that I felt could be overcome with a well thought out application. This is where my project comes in.

        <h2>Guitar Tab Repository Web Application (GuitarMate)</h2>
        <p>The Guitar Tab Repository, or 'GuitarMate' is a web-based application designed for musicians to create, manage, and share guitar tabs seamlessly with a community 
            of guitar players at all skill levels.
        </p></n>
        <p>
            Built with a modern TypeScript backend, a React frontend, and an NGINX-powered web server, this project aims to provide an intuitive platform for both beginners 
            and experienced players. It features user authentication, tab versioning, and AI-assisted auto-tab generation, setting it apart from existing solutions. 
            The repository not only helps musicians store and organize their tabs but also fosters a community-driven approach to learning and sharing music.
        </p></n>
        <p>
            The final product will be a place to share your music in a way that captures your sound, work and emotion in various formats with the ability to send it out 
            into the world for others to listen to, iterate on and encourage.
